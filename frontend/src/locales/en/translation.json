    "description": "I began my career as a teacher – a role that helped me develop communication skills, patience, and a high sense of responsibility in supporting others' growth.\n\nIn 2020, I transitioned to Digital Marketing, opening a new journey where I had the opportunity to explore the power of technology and strategic thinking.\n\nIn 2021, I took on the role of Advertising Team Leader at Winner Company, responsible for implementing communication campaigns, recruitment, and training new personnel. This period helped me perfect team leadership skills and effective organizational thinking.\n\nMoving into 2022, I joined Taipei101 Company (later OKVIP) as an SEO Website Specialist. Thanks to my experience and capabilities, I was assigned as the Lead Trainer for an SEO team and simultaneously served as an assistant to the SEO manager.\n\nIn this role, I was not only responsible for training SEO operations for team members but also supported monitoring, evaluating work effectiveness, and particularly detecting and handling fraudulent behaviors during website optimization – a job requiring finesse, logical analysis, and deep understanding of search algorithms.\n\nIn May 2024, I proactively paused my work to travel abroad, seeking to rediscover life's emotions and reorient myself. During this time, I discovered my true passion for technology and was determined to transform myself into a programmer.\n\nI enrolled in a Fullstack Web Developer course at Pantech Company while continuously self-studying and practicing daily.\n\nIn May 2025, I returned to Vietnam and began a new journey as a Fullstack Web Developer – carrying with me the combination of education, marketing, management, and programming, along with the desire to create technology products with real value.",
